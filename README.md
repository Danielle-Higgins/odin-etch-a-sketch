# odin-etch-a-sketch
This project is a challenging etch-a-sketch game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Skills
Skills I will have demonstrated once completed:

- Basic HTML, same as listed in the [odin-recipes](https://github.com/Danielle-Higgins/odin-recipes) project
- Basic CSS, same as listed in the [odin-recipes](https://github.com/Danielle-Higgins/odin-recipes) project along with
    - The box model
    - Flexbox
- JavaScript Fundamentals
    - DOM Manipulation
    - Events

## Thoughts
This project was challenging. I did struggle mainly with the JavaScript but this was good practice with DOM manipulation and events. This project gave me the chance to practice problem solving as well as getting good at asking questions. Whether that be in a chatroom or just asking a question on google. I will add more to the project as I learn more!
