I started by creating grids (boxes) inside of the blank canvas which I called a board. By default, there are 16 grids inside of the board. Next, I set up a mouse drag effect so that the grids inside of the board changed color. The user can also resize the board, meaning the user can increase of decrease the number of grids inside of the board. The user also has access to an eraser, can clear the board, and can also select a rainbow mode so that the color is that of a rainbow instead of the default black color.

## Optimizations

If/when I improve this project, I would start by making this project responsive.

## Lessons Learned:

I learned how to use the different events, such as mouseenter, mousedown, mouseup, mousemove, etc. Separation of concerns.
